# My portfolio

#####üëá
[Let's see](https://charicodazzi.github.io/PortfolioADA/)

My personal portfolio done with ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) and ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white).

I've added the code to ![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white) so that prospective employers, clients and colleagues can have a snoop around my code.

This was a task i was given while studying to become a frontend Dev. I had to do my personal portfolio following [ this reference ](https://frontend-proyecto-portfolio.adaitw.org/#about).
You'll find links to the projects i'll be adding as i improve my programming skills throughout my learning experience.
I did it during my first 3 months of learning HTML and CSS. I'm always open to critics and improvements.
